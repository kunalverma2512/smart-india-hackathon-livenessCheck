      Why Liveness Detection Matters in Aadhaar Authentication
    </h2>
    <p className="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed text-lg sm:text-xl">
      In a world where digital impersonation is on the rise, verifying whether a person is physically present during authentication is absolutely critical. Liveness detection ensures that the Aadhaar number being used is not just correct, but is being validated by a real, live individual â€” not a photo, video, or deepfake attempt.
