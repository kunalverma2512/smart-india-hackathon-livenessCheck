          <FAQItem
            question="What is the purpose of this system?"
            answer="This platform simulates Aadhaar-like face authentication using facial landmark detection and liveness checks to demonstrate secure, AI-based identity verification."
          />
          <FAQItem
            question="Do I need to install anything?"
            answer="No installation is required. The entire process runs in your browser â€” simply allow access to your camera to begin the face verification simulation."
          />
          <FAQItem
            question="What is liveness detection and why is it important?"
            answer="Liveness detection ensures that a real human is interacting with the system by analyzing facial movements, preventing spoofing attempts like using photos or videos."
          />
          <FAQItem
            question="How does the face detection system work?"
            answer="The system uses MediaPipe FaceMesh to identify 468 facial landmarks in real-time, analyzing subtle movements like blinking or turning to assess liveliness."
          />
          <FAQItem
            question="Is this linked to the official UIDAI database?"
            answer="No. This is an independent prototype created for demonstration purposes. It is not connected to UIDAI or any government servers."
          />
          <FAQItem
            question="What happens to my face data?"
            answer="Your face data is processed entirely in real-time within your browser. It is not stored or transmitted unless explicitly stated. Privacy is a key focus of this simulation."
          />
          <FAQItem
            question="Is it mobile-friendly?"
            answer="Yes. The web app is fully responsive and works seamlessly on mobile devices using the front camera."
          />
          <FAQItem
            question="Can I test it without entering an Aadhaar number?"
            answer="Yes. The system is designed to allow full testing of face detection and liveness features without entering any personal Aadhaar details. It is a standalone simulation."
          />
          <FAQItem
            question="What tech stack is used in this project?"
            answer="This prototype uses React and Tailwind CSS for the frontend. Webcam access is provided via react-webcam, and facial analysis is handled by MediaPipe FaceMesh. It's structured to support integration with real authentication APIs if needed in future deployments."
